"""
stream-processor/canonicalizer.py

Converts a decoded OTLP span dict (as produced by otlp_decoder.decode())
into a CanonicalSpanEvent by delegating to normalize_span() from the
existing demo-app observability layer.

Requires demo-app/ on PYTHONPATH:
    PYTHONPATH=/path/to/demo-app python ...

This module has NO knowledge of DLQ concepts. It raises
CanonicalizationError which callers may map to DLQ reasons as appropriate.
