"""
stream-processor/publisher.py

Kafka publishing layer for the agentops stream processor.

DELIVERY CONTRACT
-----------------
publish_span() and publish_dlq() return normally ONLY after the broker has
positively acknowledged delivery. produce() returning without error is NOT
delivery acknowledgement — it only means the message was accepted into the
local producer buffer. Acknowledgement requires a successful delivery
callback, confirmed via flush().

Any outcome without positive acknowledgement raises a PublishError subtype.
The caller must not commit the source Kafka offset in that case.

RETRY SEMANTICS
---------------
max_attempts = 1 + retries (PUBLISH_RETRIES in config)

Retriable broker errors (KafkaError.retriable() == True) and producer
queue-full (BufferError) are retried up to retries times with exponential
backoff (2, 4, 8, ... seconds). Non-retriable broker errors fail
immediately. Delivery timeouts are NOT retried — see TIMEOUT AMBIGUITY.

TIMEOUT AMBIGUITY
-----------------
A flush/delivery timeout does NOT prove Kafka failed to accept the record.
The publisher raises PublishTimeoutError immediately and does NOT re-produce
after a timeout. Re-producing would create a second queued copy and a second
outstanding delivery callback for the same logical message. The caller must
not commit the source offset; Phase 5.5/Kafka replay provides at-least-once
retry semantics. A duplicate may still arise if the original timed-out
message eventually reached Kafka; Phase 6 PostgreSQL
UNIQUE(trace_id, span_id) is the durable idempotency backstop.

OPERATIONAL vs. DATA ERRORS
----------------------------
PublishSerializationError: internal/data error — the event could not be
    serialized. Source offset must not be committed. For publish_span(),
    Phase 5.5 must surface this as a processing failure (not converted into
    a DLQ reason; the DLQ reason taxonomy is locked in Phase 5.2). For
    publish_dlq(), never attempt to DLQ-the-DLQ.

PublishBrokerError / PublishTimeoutError: operational errors — not
    converted into DLQ data-quality events.

FUTURE THROUGHPUT
-----------------
Phase 5.4 uses synchronous per-message acknowledgement (produce + flush per
call). A future optimization may require an evolved API (batch publishing,
futures, or explicit acknowledgement draining) — it cannot be transparently
substituted behind the current synchronous return contract.

THREAD SAFETY
-------------
KafkaPublisher is NOT thread-safe. Designed for single-threaded use.

DEPENDENCIES
------------
confluent_kafka (runtime), config, dlq. No demo-app/ dependency at runtime.
CanonicalSpanEvent is referenced for type-checking only.
