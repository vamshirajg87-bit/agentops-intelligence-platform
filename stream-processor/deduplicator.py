stream-processor/deduplicator.py

Bounded in-memory deduplication for canonical span events.

PURPOSE
-------
Kafka delivers messages at-least-once. A span may be redelivered if the
consumer crashes after publishing output but before committing its offset.
SpanDeduplicator suppresses within-process duplicate deliveries so the
downstream publish step is not called redundantly for the same logical span.

SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS
---------------------
- Process-lifetime only. Restarting the process clears the deduplicator;
  any span replayed across a restart passes through as new.
- This component does NOT provide exactly-once processing. It is a
  best-effort within-process guard.
- Durable idempotent uniqueness is enforced in Phase 6 via a PostgreSQL
  UNIQUE(trace_id, span_id) constraint with ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING.

IDENTITY
--------
Logical identity is exactly (trace_id, span_id). No other fields
(service_name, span_name, attributes, Kafka offset, etc.) affect identity.

MEMORY
------
Memory usage is bounded by max_size. Actual consumption depends on Python
object and container overhead per entry; it grows until max_size entries
are held and stays there under LRU eviction.

THREAD SAFETY
-------------
SpanDeduplicator is NOT thread-safe. It is designed for use from a single
consumer thread. If the processor loop is parallelised, add external locking
at the call site.

DEPENDENCIES
------------
None beyond the Python standard library. No Kafka, DLQ, or demo-app
knowledge.
