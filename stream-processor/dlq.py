"""
stream-processor/dlq.py

DLQ event model and builder for the agentops stream processor.

DLQEvent is published to the agentops.telemetry.dlq Kafka topic when a
Kafka message cannot be processed due to a data-quality or poison-message
failure. Operational failures (broker unavailable, network errors, publish
timeouts) are NOT represented here — they are handled by the retry/backoff
logic in the publisher layer.

Privacy policy
--------------
No raw protobuf bytes are stored in DLQEvent. The source_topic /
source_partition / source_offset triple is the replay coordinate: a
consumer can seek back to the original message as long as the source topic's
retention covers that offset.

source_payload_sha256 is identification and debug metadata only. It cannot
reconstruct the original payload and does not change the privacy posture of
the DLQ topic.

Schema versioning
-----------------
schema_version and event_type are Pydantic Literal fields. A consumer that
deserializes a payload with an unexpected schema_version receives a
ValidationError before processing begins, making incompatible changes
detectable at the boundary rather than silently corrupting downstream state.
