alerting/alert_guardrails.py

Phase 13.6: Operational guardrails.

Four report-only checks on the detection, investigation and delivery
pipeline.  They observe and report.  They never write, never retry, never
run a detector or an analysis, and never change anything.

    detector_checkpoint_stale   an expected detection group has no
                                checkpoint, or its checkpoint is too old
    uninvestigated_anomalies    an anomaly has had no investigation for too
                                long
    delivery_uncertain          the delivery of an alert on a channel is
                                UNCERTAIN: it may or may not have arrived
    delivery_exhausted          the delivery of an alert on a channel is
                                EXHAUSTED, PERMANENTLY_FAILED or EXPIRED:
                                the automatic run will not deliver it

Results
-------
Every run returns exactly four GuardrailResult values, in the order above.
A result holds the finding (code, status, full count, fixed text) and the
identifiers of the first violations, at most MAX_DETAIL_IDS of them.

Thresholds come from the guardrails section of the alert policy.  E is the
time of a stored record and now is supplied by the caller:

    checkpoint   stale when now - updated_at  > detector_checkpoint_max_age
    anomaly      overdue when now - detected_at > uninvestigated_anomaly_max_age
    delivery     considered when evaluated_at, or the start of the latest
                 attempt, is at or after now - delivery_lookback_hours

A record exactly at a threshold is not a violation, and neither is one dated
later than now.  A delivery exactly at the lookback start is considered.

Expected detection groups
-------------------------
The policy does not say which checkpoints should exist.  The expected groups
are read from the anomaly detector's runner configuration file by
load_expected_groups(), which reads its "groups" list and nothing else.
Checkpoints of other groups are ignored.

Deliveries
----------
A delivery is one ALERT decision on one channel that is enabled in the
current policy.  Its state is derived by alert_delivery_state.derive_state,
unchanged, with the channel's current settings.  Channels that are disabled
or no longer in the policy are not considered; with no enabled channel both
delivery checks report no violation.

Fail closed
-----------
Stored data that is malformed or inconsistent raises
GuardrailEvaluationError, which carries the affected guardrail codes and a
fixed reason code and nothing else.  No result is returned in that case, so
a check that could not be completed is never reported as passed.

Standard library and the locked alerting contracts only.  Database access
goes through alert_guardrail_store; this module contains no database
statement and does not import a database driver.  It reads no clock and no
environment, and the only file it reads is the detector configuration.

    Run the four guardrails and return their results.

    Parameters
    ----------
    conn
        Open connection for the evaluator's database role, preferably a
        read-only session.  The caller owns it: this function does not commit, roll
        back or close.
    policy
        The validated policy.  Its guardrails section gives the thresholds
        and its delivery section the channels and their settings.
    expected_groups
        The detection groups that should have a checkpoint, from
        load_expected_groups().
    now
        The time of this run: one timezone-aware value, used for every
        check.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple of GuardrailResult
        Exactly four, in GUARDRAIL_CODES order.

    ------
    ValueError
        policy is not an AlertPolicy, now is not a timezone-aware datetime,

    GuardrailEvaluationError
