alerting/alert_guardrail_store.py

Phase 13.6: Database access for the operational guardrails.

This module holds every SQL statement of the guardrails.  All four are
SELECT statements: the guardrails only observe and report, so nothing is ever
written, changed or removed.

Role
----
All statements run as the alert_evaluator role (migration 013) and use only
what that role is granted:

    public.anomaly_detector_runs    SELECT on signal_path, service_name,
                                    operation_name, updated_at
    public.anomaly_events           SELECT on anomaly_id, detected_at
    public.rca_investigations       SELECT on anomaly_id (and nine others)
    public.alert_decisions          SELECT
    public.alert_delivery_attempts  SELECT
    public.alert_delivery_outcomes  SELECT

No summary, limitation, payload, explanation or outcome detail is read, and
nothing from telemetry, evidence, embeddings or the analytics schema.

Statements
----------
    S1  every detector checkpoint
    S2  every anomaly that has no investigation, of any age
    S3  ALERT decisions evaluated at or after a point in time, or with an
        attempt started at or after it
    S4  the delivery attempts of given decisions on given channels, each
        with its outcome when one was recorded

No statement compares against the database clock.  Time bounds are computed
by the caller and bound as parameters; age thresholds are applied by the
caller, not in SQL.

Transactions
------------
Functions here never commit or roll back.  The caller owns the transaction
and supplies an open connection, which it also closes.

SQL safety
----------
All values are %(name)s bound parameters.  No string interpolation.  Explicit
column lists.  No SELECT *.
