alerting/alert_engine.py

Phase 13.3: Pure alert policy engine.

Decides, for one RCA investigation, whether it becomes an alert:

    decide(subject, history, evaluation, evaluated_at) -> EngineDecision

The engine is a pure function.  The same subject, history, evaluation policy
and evaluated_at always give the same result.  It reads no clock: the
evaluation time is supplied by the caller.

RCA confidence, limitations and summary are not inputs.  No input type has a
field for them, so they cannot influence a decision.

History
-------
history holds prior persisted ALERT decisions, of every policy version.  The
engine does not fetch it; the caller supplies it.  The order of history does
not matter.  The engine applies each window itself, so history may hold more
alerts than a rule needs.

Rules (first match wins)
------------------------
E is the subject's event_time.  E' is the event_time of a prior alert.

    1. kill switch   evaluation.enabled is false
                     -> SUPPRESSED / kill_switch
    2. severity      subject severity below evaluation.min_severity
                     -> NOT_ALERTABLE / below_min_severity
    3. stale         evaluated_at - E > max_alert_age_minutes
                     -> NOT_ALERTABLE / stale
                     Exactly max_alert_age_minutes old is not stale.  An
                     event_time later than evaluated_at is not stale.
    4. duplicate     a prior alert has the same anomaly_id (no time bound)
                     -> SUPPRESSED / duplicate_anomaly
    5. cooldown      W = prior alerts with the same dedup_key and
                         E - cooldown_minutes < E' <= E
                     W empty: the rule does not apply.
                     Otherwise, when escalation_breaks_cooldown is true and
                     the subject's severity is strictly higher than every
                     severity in W, the subject is an escalation and
                     evaluation continues with rule 6.
                     In every other case -> SUPPRESSED / cooldown
    6. storm cap     number of prior alerts, of any dedup_key, with
                         E - 60 minutes < E' <= E
                     is >= max_alerts_per_hour
                     -> SUPPRESSED / storm_cap
                     An escalation is capped like any other alert.
    7. otherwise     -> ALERT / escalation   when rule 5 found an escalation
                     -> ALERT / severity_met otherwise

Both windows are strictly historical: a prior alert whose event_time is later
than E never takes part in rule 5 or rule 6.  The lower bound is exclusive
and the upper bound inclusive.  cooldown_minutes = 0 makes W empty.

Related decision
----------------
    duplicate_anomaly      the smallest decision_id among the matching alerts
    cooldown, escalation   chosen from W: highest severity, then the alert
                           closest in time to E, then the smallest
                           decision_id
    every other reason     None

Time handling
-------------
Every datetime must be timezone-aware; any UTC offset is accepted.  All of
them are converted to UTC before they are compared or subtracted.  This is
required for correctness: Python compares two datetimes that share one tzinfo
object by their wall-clock fields, which is wrong for a zone whose offset
changes.

Fail closed
-----------
All inputs are validated before rule 1.  Anything invalid raises ValueError
and no decision is produced, whatever the policy says.

Standard library only.  No database access, no I/O, no logging.
