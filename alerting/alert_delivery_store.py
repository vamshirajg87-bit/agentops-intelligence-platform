alerting/alert_delivery_store.py

Phase 13.5: Database access for alert notification.

This module holds every SQL statement of the alert notifier.  It reads the
persisted alert decisions, reads the delivery records of a decision, and
appends one row to public.alert_delivery_attempts or
public.alert_delivery_outcomes.

Role
----
All statements run as the alert_notifier role (migration 014) and use only
what that role is granted:

    public.alert_decisions          SELECT on eight columns
    public.alert_delivery_attempts  INSERT, SELECT
    public.alert_delivery_outcomes  INSERT, SELECT

Nothing is read from any RCA, anomaly, telemetry, embedding or policy table.

Discovery
---------
fetch_alert_decisions() returns every decision whose verdict is ALERT, of
every policy version and of any age, ordered evaluated_at ASC, then
decision_id ASC.  Whether an alert is still deliverable is decided from its
delivery state by the caller, not by this module.

Idempotency
-----------
attempt rows:  ON CONFLICT (decision_id, channel_name, attempt_no) DO NOTHING
outcome rows:  ON CONFLICT (attempt_id) DO NOTHING

An existing row is never overwritten.  No UPDATE, no DELETE.  A caller whose
attempt row was not inserted does not own that attempt and must not send.

Transactions
------------
Functions here never commit or roll back.  The caller owns the transaction
and supplies an open connection, which it also closes.

SQL safety
----------
All values are %(name)s bound parameters.  No string interpolation.  Explicit
column lists.  No SELECT *.

started_at and recorded_at are not supplied; the columns have DEFAULT NOW().

Public API:
    fetch_alert_decisions()         — every ALERT decision, oldest first
    fetch_recent_alert_decisions()  — the newest ALERT decisions
    fetch_decision()                — one decision of any verdict, or None
    fetch_delivery_history()        — delivery records of several decisions
    fetch_channel_history()         — delivery records of one decision on
                                      one channel
    insert_attempt()                — insert one attempt; True if inserted
    insert_outcome()                — insert one outcome; True if inserted
