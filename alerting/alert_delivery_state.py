alerting/alert_delivery_state.py

Phase 13.5: Delivery state of one alert on one channel.

The delivery state is never stored.  It is derived from the append-only
delivery records of one (decision_id, channel_name) pair:

    derive_state(attempts, outcomes, evaluated_at=..., now=..., ...)

The functions here are pure.  They read no clock, no environment and no
database: the current time and every setting are supplied by the caller.

States
------
T is the latest attempt, the one with the highest attempt_no.

    SENT                any attempt has the outcome SENT
    NEVER_ATTEMPTED     there is no attempt
    IN_FLIGHT           T has no outcome and
                        now - T.started_at <= timeout_seconds + 30 seconds
    UNCERTAIN           T has no outcome and is older than that, or
                        T has the outcome UNCERTAIN
    PERMANENTLY_FAILED  T has the outcome FAILED_PERMANENT
    RETRYABLE           T has the outcome FAILED_RETRYABLE and
                        T.attempt_no < max_attempts
    EXHAUSTED           T has the outcome FAILED_RETRYABLE and
                        T.attempt_no >= max_attempts
    EXPIRED             the state would be NEVER_ATTEMPTED or RETRYABLE and
                        now - evaluated_at > max_delivery_age_minutes

Exactly max_delivery_age_minutes old is not expired, and an evaluated_at
later than now is not expired.  An attempt that started later than now is
IN_FLIGHT.  Attempts made by an operator count like any other attempt.

Eligibility
-----------
    automatic   NEVER_ATTEMPTED, RETRYABLE
    operator    EXHAUSTED, PERMANENTLY_FAILED, EXPIRED;
                UNCERTAIN only with an explicit confirmation, because the
                alert may already have been delivered
    nobody      SENT, IN_FLIGHT

Fail closed
-----------
A history that cannot have been written by the notifier raises
DeliveryHistoryError and yields no state, so nothing is sent on the basis of
it.  All datetimes must be timezone-aware; they are converted to UTC before
they are compared.

Standard library and the locked alerting contracts only.

Public API:
    DeliveryState               — the eight states
    IN_FLIGHT_GRACE             — 30 seconds
    DeliveryHistoryError        — the delivery records are not consistent
    REFUSAL_*                   — fixed refusal codes
    derive_state()              — the state of one decision on one channel
    next_attempt_no()           — the number of the next attempt
    check_eligibility()         — None when an attempt is allowed
