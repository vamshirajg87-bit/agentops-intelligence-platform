alerting/alert_evaluator.py

Phase 13.4: Batch alert evaluation.

Evaluates every RCA investigation that has no decision under the current
policy version, and records one decision for each:

    register policy -> discover candidates -> for each candidate:
        build subject -> fetch history -> decide -> build decision -> store

The verdict itself comes from alert_engine.decide(), which is used unchanged.
This module supplies its inputs and records its output.

Policy registration
-------------------
The policy version is registered with the hash and the canonical evaluation
object of alert_policy.  A version that is already registered with the same
hash is accepted.  A version registered with a different hash raises
PolicyVersionConflictError before any investigation is evaluated.

Order
-----
Candidates are processed in event_time order, then investigation_id order.
Each decision is committed before the next candidate is read, so a later
candidate sees the alerts raised earlier in the same run.

History
-------
For a candidate with event_time E, converted to UTC first:

    cooldown window starts at  E - cooldown_minutes
    storm window starts at     E - alert_engine.STORM_WINDOW

A start that cannot be represented is clamped to the earliest datetime.  The
store returns the persisted alerts the three rules need.  They are merged by
decision_id, so the engine never receives one decision twice.

Informational fields
--------------------
confidence, limitations and summary are copied into the decision.  They are
never passed to the engine and cannot change a verdict.

Summary
-------
A summary is stored only for an ALERT and only when the policy sets
persist_summary.  It is cut to SUMMARY_MAX_CODE_POINTS Unicode code points.
It is never part of the payload.

Dry run
-------
With dry_run=True nothing is written and nothing is committed.  The policy is
looked up but not registered.  Each ALERT the run would raise is remembered
and added to the history of the later candidates, so the verdicts equal those
of a real run from the same database state.

Failure policy
--------------
A ValueError raised for one candidate — malformed stored data, or input the
models or the engine reject — is recorded as a 'failure' and the run
continues.  Any other exception, a database error in particular, stops the
run and propagates.  The open transaction is rolled back in both cases.

Transactions
------------
This module commits and rolls back on the supplied connection.  It never
closes it.  Database access goes through alert_store; this module contains no
database statement and does not import a database driver.  It reads no clock:
the evaluation time is supplied by the caller.
