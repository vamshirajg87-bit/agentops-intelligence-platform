alerting/alert_notifier.py

Phase 13.5: Alert notification.

Delivers persisted ALERT decisions to the enabled channels of the delivery
policy and records every attempt and its outcome.

Only the decision snapshot is used: the notification body is built from the
payload stored with the decision.  Nothing is read from RCA, anomaly or
telemetry data, and no decision is ever evaluated here.

One attempt
-----------
For one decision on one channel:

    T1   read the delivery records again -> derive the state -> check that
         an attempt is allowed -> take the next attempt number -> build the
         body -> write the attempt row -> commit
    send the body, with no transaction open
    T2   write the outcome row -> commit

The committed attempt row is the durable record that an attempt started.
Nothing is sent unless this process wrote and committed that row itself:

    the attempt is not allowed      nothing is written, nothing is sent
    the attempt row was not written another writer owns that attempt number;
                                    nothing is sent and no other number is
                                    tried ('lost_race')
    T1 fails                        rolled back, nothing is sent

If the outcome cannot be recorded, or the process stops after T1, the attempt
keeps no outcome.  It is then in flight, and later uncertain: the alert may
have been delivered, so only an operator may resend it.

Automatic run
-------------
run_notify() takes every ALERT decision, oldest evaluation first (then
decision_id), and for each the enabled channels in policy order.  It makes at
most one attempt per decision and channel, never waits and never repeats.
It acts only on deliveries that were never attempted or failed retryably,
and not once they have expired.  A decision of any policy version is
delivered under the delivery settings supplied by the caller.

Operator retry
--------------
retry_delivery() makes one attempt for a delivery the automatic run will not
touch: exhausted, permanently failed, expired, or — only with an explicit
confirmation — uncertain.

Dry run
-------
With dry_run=True the state and the body are computed and nothing is written,
committed or sent.  The number the next attempt would get is reported; no
attempt identity is computed.

Failure policy
--------------
Malformed stored data for one decision and channel is reported as
'invalid_data' and the run continues.  A database error stops the run and
propagates; the open transaction is rolled back first.  KeyboardInterrupt is
not caught and no outcome is written for an interrupted delivery.

This module commits and rolls back on the supplied connection and never
closes it.  Database access goes through alert_delivery_store; this module
contains no database statement and does not import a database driver.  It
reads no clock and no environment: the current time and the prepared
channels are supplied by the caller.

    Parameters
    ----------
    conn
        Open connection for the alert_notifier role.  The caller owns the
        connection lifecycle; this function does NOT close it.  It must not
        carry uncommitted work of the caller.  For a dry run the caller
        should supply a read-only session.
    channels
        The prepared channels to deliver to, in policy order.  A disabled
        channel is skipped; an empty sequence delivers nothing.
    delivery
        The delivery section of the policy.
    now
        The time of this run: one timezone-aware value, used for every
        state.
    dry_run
        When True, nothing is written, committed or sent.
    log_stream
        Binary stream of the log channel.
    on_result
        Optional callback invoked with each DeliveryResult as soon as it is
        known, in processing order.

    Returns
    -------
    NotifyReport
