alerting/alert_store.py

Phase 13.4: Database access for alert evaluation.

This module holds every SQL statement of the alert evaluator.  It registers
a policy version, lists the investigations that have no decision under a
policy version, reads the alert history one evaluation needs, and writes one
row to public.alert_decisions.

Role
----
All statements run as the alert_evaluator role (migration 013) and use only
what that role is granted:

    public.rca_investigations  SELECT on ten columns
    public.alert_policies      INSERT, SELECT
    public.alert_decisions     INSERT, SELECT

Idempotency
-----------
policy rows:    ON CONFLICT (policy_version) DO NOTHING
decision rows:  ON CONFLICT (investigation_id, policy_version) DO NOTHING

First-write-wins: an existing row is never overwritten.  No UPDATE, no DELETE.

Transactions
------------
Functions here never commit or roll back.  The caller owns the transaction
and supplies an open connection, which it also closes.

SQL safety
----------
All values are %(name)s bound parameters.  No string interpolation.  Explicit
column lists.  No SELECT *.  Window bounds are computed by the caller and
bound as timestamps; no time arithmetic is done in SQL.

registered_at and decided_at are not supplied; the columns have DEFAULT NOW().

Alert history
-------------
fetch_alert_history() runs three statements and merges their rows by
decision_id.  Every statement reads ALERT decisions only, of every policy
version.  E is the event_time of the investigation being evaluated.

    duplicate   the same anomaly_id, with no time bound
    cooldown    the same dedup_key and  cooldown_start < event_time <= E
    storm       any dedup_key and       storm_start    < event_time <= E

The lower bound is exclusive and the upper bound inclusive.

Public API:
    fetch_policy_sha256()   — stored hash of a policy version, or None
    insert_policy()         — register a policy version; True if inserted
    fetch_candidates()      — investigations without a decision, in order
    fetch_alert_history()   — merged alert history for one evaluation
    insert_decision()       — insert one decision; True if inserted
