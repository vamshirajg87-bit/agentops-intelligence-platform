alerting/tests/integration/test_live_phase13_e2e.py

Opt-in end-to-end validation of Phase 13 against live PostgreSQL (Phase 13.7).

One ordered story through the locked components, each under its own
restricted role:

    fixture anomalies and investigations
      -> run_evaluation            (alert_evaluator)   decisions
      -> run_guardrails            (alert_evaluator)   nothing delivered yet
      -> run_notify                (alert_notifier)    attempts and outcomes
      -> show_alert                (alert_notifier)    derived delivery states
      -> run_guardrails            (alert_evaluator)   failures are visible
      -> replay of both runs                           nothing is repeated
      -> a late investigation      -> evaluated and delivered exactly once
      -> retry_delivery            (alert_notifier)    operator refusals, retries
      -> run_guardrails            (alert_evaluator)   final picture

It adds no feature and replaces nothing: the decision engine, the stores, the
delivery state machine, the channels and the guardrails are the production
ones, called unchanged.

Skipped by default.  It runs only when the switch is set:

    ALERTING_RUN_DB_TESTS=1

and an administrator password is supplied through the environment:

    ALERTING_E2E_ADMIN_PASSWORD   required; there is no default
    ALERTING_E2E_ADMIN_USER       default: agentops

Host, port and database come from ALERT_EVALUATOR_DB_HOST / _PORT / _NAME
(defaults localhost / 5432 / agentops).  The passwords of the restricted
roles are NOT needed.  Migrations 012, 013 and 014 must be applied.

What is production and what is harness
--------------------------------------
PRODUCTION PATH (measured):
    run_evaluation, run_notify, retry_delivery, show_alert, run_guardrails
    and everything they call.  Every decision, attempt and outcome that an
    assertion looks at was written by them.

HARNESS SETUP (not evidence):
    the fixture anomalies, investigations and checkpoints; the policy row,
    written through the production store function before the run so that
    the shield rows below can refer to it; the shield rows; the savepoint
    wrapper; role switching; the injected times; the temporary paths; the
    log stream that cannot be written.

HARNESS OBSERVATION:
    SELECT statements on the stored rows, reading the notification file, and
    the baseline digests.

Anomaly detection and RCA analysis themselves are not run.  Their output is
represented by fixture rows.

Only fixtures are evaluated and delivered
-----------------------------------------
The evaluator decides every investigation that has no decision under the
policy version, and the notifier delivers every ALERT decision.  So that
neither touches a row of the real database:

  - every investigation that existed before the test gets a NOT_ALERTABLE
    shield decision under the fixture policy version, so it is not a
    candidate;
  - every ALERT decision that existed before the test gets a SENT shield
    delivery on each fixture channel, so it is not delivered again.

Shield rows are written by the administrator inside the transaction and
disappear with it.  No assertion about the product is made on them.  Before
every notifier call the test stops if an ALERT decision exists that is
neither a fixture nor shielded.

Nothing is ever committed
-------------------------
The whole module runs inside ONE transaction on ONE administrator connection,
and that transaction is rolled back when the module finishes.  The product
code calls commit() and rollback() itself; it is given a wrapper
(_SavepointConnection) that maps those calls onto a savepoint inside the
outer transaction.  The role is switched with SET LOCAL ROLE before a new
savepoint is opened, so a product rollback never changes the role.

Known limits of this arrangement:
  - one session plays the evaluator, the notifier and the guardrails; what
    one session's commit makes visible to another is not exercised;
  - NOW() is constant inside one transaction, so every started_at,
    recorded_at and decided_at holds the same real time, which is later than
    the injected run times;
  - the connection factories and the command-line programs are not used.

Time
----
Every fixture time and every injected run time lies in an isolated period
around 2001-04-01 12:00 UTC.  No expected value depends on the wall clock.
The module is skipped when the database holds rows dated inside or before
that period.

No network
----------
The channels are two files and the log stream.  No webhook channel is
configured, and while the module runs any attempt to open a socket from
Python fails the test.  The database connection is opened before that.

The fixture SQL below exists only in this test.  Production SQL lives only in
the alerting store modules.

Test inventory:
    E01  each stage runs as its restricted role
    E02  the roles cannot do each other's work
    E03  evaluation: six verdicts
    E04  stored decisions and payloads
    E05  guardrails before any delivery
    E06  notification: one attempt per alert and channel
    E07  stored attempts and outcomes
    E08  the notification file and the body digests
    E09  delivery states seen by an operator
    E10  guardrails after delivery
    E11  evaluation replay decides nothing
    E12  notification replay delivers nothing
    E13  a late investigation is decided and delivered exactly once
    E14  guardrails after the late alert
    E15  operator retries that are refused
    E16  confirmed resend of an uncertain delivery
    E17  operator retry of a permanent failure
    E18  guardrails after the operator's actions
    E19  guardrails are repeatable and write nothing
    (teardown) outer rollback restores every table exactly
