workload_generator/rng.py

Seeded draws for the planner.

Every draw stream is derived from the master seed, a namespace and an index
through SHA-256, so the stream for request N depends on nothing but those
three values: not on how many requests are planned around it, not on the
order they are later executed in, and not on Python's per-process hash
randomization.

Only random.Random.random() is used as the source of randomness.  Its output
for a given seed is stable across Python versions; the distribution helpers
of the random module are not promised to be, so the few distributions needed
here are written out.

Standard library only.

Public API:
    derive_hex()   a stable hexadecimal digest of the given parts
    Draw           one seeded stream with the distributions the planner uses
