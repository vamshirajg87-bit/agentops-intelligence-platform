workload_generator/faults.py

Phase 14.3C: Generator-owned fault injection.

Carries out, inside the generator's own process, what a plan intends for one
execution attempt: how long each step takes, whether the tool call fails,
and whether the document lookup returns a degraded result.  The demo
application's files are not changed.  While an injector is installed, three
of its functions are replaced in memory by wrappers that call the originals:

    the tool call           <tool module>.run_tool
    the document lookup     <retrieval module>.retrieve
    the answer-building     <instrumentation module>.research_synthesize_node
    step

The third is the reference the instrumentation module itself imported; it is
the name looked up when the step runs.  All three wrappers run inside the
span the application already creates for the step, so the added time and the
raised error appear in the telemetry the application already emits.

The planner decides WHAT happens; this module only does it.  It draws no
random number and makes no scenario decision.

One set of wrappers, one context per attempt
--------------------------------------------
installed() replaces the three functions ONCE, for the whole run, and puts
the originals back when the run ends.  It is not entered per request:
installing and removing per request would be unsafe as soon as two requests
are in flight.

applied(effects) makes one attempt's effects current for the code it
encloses.  They are held in a context variable, so two attempts running at
the same time each see their own.  Outside applied() the wrappers call the
originals and do nothing else: no pause, no failure, no change.

Known assumption: the wrappers see the effects because the application's
graph runs its steps in the context of the caller.  That was observed for
LangGraph 1.2.11 and the application's linear graph.  Should it change, the
wrappers would be reached without effects and inject nothing; applied()
therefore yields a Reach that records which wrappers an attempt reached
under its effects, and Reach.problems() says what is missing.

Waiting
-------
Latency is applied by calling a `pause` function given to the injector by
its caller, with seconds as its argument.  This module does not import a
clock and never waits on its own.  The planned latencies are workload
simulation assumptions; they are not measurements, benchmarks or objectives.

Failures
--------
A planned failure is raised from the tool wrapper in place of the tool call.
Three kinds are defined here.  The fourth, ToolExecutionError, is the
application's own exception class, taken from the tool module the caller
supplied; it is not defined again.

Standard library only.  Nothing of the demo application is imported here;
its modules are handed in by the caller.
