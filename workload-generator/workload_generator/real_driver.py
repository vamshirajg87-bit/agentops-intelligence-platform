workload_generator/real_driver.py

Phase 14.3D: The REAL driver.

Executes a plan through the demo application's own compiled agent graph, with
the application's own instrumentation, and exports the resulting spans by
OTLP gRPC to one explicitly named collector endpoint:

    PlannedRequest -> attempts() -> FaultInjector -> graph -> spans -> OTLP

The driver decides nothing about the traffic.  Which request runs when, what
is slow, what fails and what is retried were all decided by the planner; the
driver carries the plan out, checks every attempt against it, and reports
what it did.

What is and is not changed
--------------------------
No file of the demo application is changed.  For the duration of one run,
four names inside its already imported modules are rebound in this process
and put back afterwards: the three functions the fault injector wraps, and
the tracer of the instrumentation module.

The tracer provider belongs to the driver and is NOT registered as the
process-wide provider.  The instrumentation module reads its module-level
tracer each time a step runs; while a run is in progress that name refers to
the driver's tracer, so the application's spans and the driver's root span
come from one provider and form one trace.  The application's own telemetry
setup is never called: no console output, no direct Kafka export.

One way out
-----------
The only thing this module sends anywhere is spans, to the endpoint it was
given.  There is no default endpoint.  It opens no database connection and
uses no Kafka client.  Environment variables are read for one purpose only:
to refuse to run when any OpenTelemetry (OTEL_*) variable is set, because
such variables can silently disable or alter an explicitly configured
provider.

What the report can claim
-------------------------
The driver knows how many spans ended and for how many its local exporter
returned success.  It does not know, and never says, what a collector, Kafka
or a database did with them.

Integrity
---------
An attempt that fails as planned is a result of the workload.  An attempt
that does something the plan does not describe (an unplanned failure, a
planned failure that did not happen, a fault wrapper that was not reached)
is an integrity problem: no further work is started, running work finishes,
spans are flushed, and the run is reported as stopped.

Imports
-------
Only the standard library is imported when this module is loaded.  The
OpenTelemetry packages and the demo application are imported inside the
functions that need them, so that the checks which refuse a run can happen
first.
