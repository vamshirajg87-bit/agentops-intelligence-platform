"""
workload_generator/scenarios.py

The scenario vocabulary of the workload generator, and where in a plan each
scenario's abnormal traffic falls.

A scenario here is planning metadata only.  It says which step of the demo
agent is meant to be affected, how (slower, failing, timing out), with which
error type, and over which part of the run.  Nothing in this module waits,
raises an injected failure or touches the demo application; a later phase
reads this metadata and acts on it.

What can be affected is limited to what the demo agent really has:

    tool.execute         the one tool call
    retrieval.search     the document lookup
    research.synthesize  the step that builds the answer

The agent calls no language model and records no model, provider or token
data, so no scenario refers to any of those.  Failures are planned on the
tool call only: it is the only step whose error type the existing
instrumentation records.

Episodes
--------
Abnormal traffic is never spread evenly.  It is planned in episodes: runs of
consecutive requests.  A single-incident scenario has healthy traffic first,
one episode, then recovery.  RECURRING_INCIDENT has two episodes of the same
failure with healthy traffic between them.  MIXED_PRODUCTION has several
short episodes of different kinds that together cover about 5% of the run.

Standard library only.
