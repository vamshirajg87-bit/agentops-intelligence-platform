"""
workload_generator/personas.py

The four traffic profiles of the workload generator.

These are NOT four different agents.  The demo application has one fixed
workflow; a persona describes who is using it: which questions are asked,
how many requests share a session, and how quickly they follow each other.

The query pools are written out in full so that they can be reviewed.  They
are tied to what the demo agent really knows: its tool recognises five
technologies (LangGraph, OpenTelemetry, Apache Kafka, retrieval-augmented
generation, PostgreSQL) and its retrieval step searches six short documents
about the same subjects.  A unit test runs every query through the demo's
own tool and retrieval functions and checks the outcome each persona is
meant to have.

Standard library only.
