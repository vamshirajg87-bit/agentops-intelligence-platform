"""
workload-generator/run_pipeline_it.py

One functional integration test of the containerized ingestion pipeline
(docker/compose.pipeline.yml) on a separate, disposable Compose project:

    REAL driver -> OTLP -> collector -> Kafka raw topic -> stream processor (container)
        -> Kafka canonical topic -> storage consumer (container) -> PostgreSQL

It is NOT a benchmark: nothing is timed, no throughput or latency is judged, and
nothing is written to the benchmark directory or ledger.

It only ORCHESTRATES.  The disposable stack, its readiness checks, the generator
run, the exact Kafka and database reconciliation and the cleanup are
run_smoke.py's, imported and unchanged; this file points them at its own project
name and consumer groups at run time and adds what is new: the two processing
services, and the checks that they used the disposable broker and database.

Isolation, in the order it is established
    - a unique project name "agentops-pipeline-it-<8 hex>", never "agentops", and
      none that any Docker object already carries
    - run_smoke's own override, unchanged: every fixed container name removed,
      every published port loopback-only (127.0.0.1 14317, 19092, 15432)
    - the project's network and volumes are named after the project
    - image names are the project's (the overlay has no fixed tag)
    - throw-away random passwords in a temporary directory outside the repository
    - consumer groups of its own, on a broker of its own
    - refuses to start while a benchmark process, marker or project is present
    - the generator refuses the platform's own ports 4317 and 4318
    - cleanup is "docker compose down --volumes --rmi local --remove-orphans" for
      this project only, and nothing else is ever deleted: run_smoke's cleanup() is
      NOT called, because it also removes every image and volume that merely appeared
      since the run began, whoever made it.  Here, a leftover image of this project is
      removed only by its exact name, which must start with the project name and carry
      its Compose label; objects found by comparing inventories are REPORTED, never
      removed; no prune of any kind

    python workload-generator/run_pipeline_it.py --expect-head <commit>

Exit codes:
    0  every check passed and cleanup was verified
    1  anything else

Nothing is retried.  Standard library only.
