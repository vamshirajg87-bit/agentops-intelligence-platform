benchmarks/calibrate_generator.py

Generator-only calibration, condition A: how much do the workload
generator's own request starts lag behind their planned times, with no
AgentOps platform running at all?

The real scheduling path is reused unchanged: real_driver.execute() with its
dispatcher, semaphore, ThreadPoolExecutor, fault injector, BatchSpanProcessor
and start-lag diagnostic, driven by the real clock (time.monotonic) and the
real pause (time.sleep).  Only the span exporter differs: spans go to an
in-memory exporter, so nothing is exported anywhere.  run_real, its
reachability check and the OTLP exporter are never called.

Traffic is the SMOKE cell's: seed 42, warm-up 25 and measured 100 requests,
rate 5 per second, concurrency 32 (arrivals and planned latencies depend on
the seed only).  Run ids are cal-a-wNN / cal-a-mNN; calibration ids are
cal-a-NN, never benchmark (bm-) ids.

Two modes in this one file:
    orchestrator  plans the series; with --execute runs it, one child
                  process at a time, under an exclusive ACTIVE_CALIBRATION
                  ownership record, with exclusive journal, output and result
                  files per run
    child         (--child, started only by the orchestrator) checks the
                  series token, installs the Python network guard, then
                  imports the driver and the demo agent, runs warm-up +
                  measured, writes its result, and exits with its own status

Execution gates (all must hold; none is enough alone):
    - EXECUTION_ENABLED is True (it is False here);
    - every calibration id is in APPROVED_CALIBRATIONS (empty here);
    - --expect-head is the full 40-character Git HEAD and equals it;
    - a child runs only with the series token of the ACTIVE_CALIBRATION
      record in its output directory.
  authorize() is the only way to obtain an Authorization.  Every function
  that could start a process, import the driver or the demo, or observe the
  host requires one, so changing EXECUTION_ENABLED alone starts nothing.
  child_main() and run_series() take their dependencies explicitly; the
  production dependencies come only from the gated factories.

Network safety, stated precisely:
    - The intended denial mechanism is a Windows AppContainer with NO
      capabilities (no internetClient, internetClientServer or
      privateNetworkClientServer) and no loopback exemption: Windows then
      refuses the child's outbound and loopback connections in the kernel,
      for native code too.  The Win32 backend (ctypes, documented APIs)
      starts the base interpreter directly - never the venv launcher, whose
      own child would be a second process - suspended, inside the profile
      whose SID is AUTHORIZED_APPCONTAINER_SID (None here) and whose
      independently verified preflight record matches
      AUTHORIZED_PROFILE_PREFLIGHT_SHA256 (None here; GetAppContainerFolderPath
      is supplementary and is not proof that a profile exists).  It checks
      the real token, process identity and loopback exemption, and only then
      resumes it; otherwise the suspended child is terminated and its exit
      verified, or its PID and handles are kept for inspection.  Execution
      history (never / may have executed / unknown) and liveness (confirmed
      exited / alive at last check / unknown) are recorded separately in
      every journal.  AppContainer compatibility of CPython, the venv
      packages and the demo is NOT assumed: the isolation probe must show
      it first.
    - The isolation probe (--probe, separately gated by PROBE_ENABLED and
      APPROVED_PROBES, both closed here) runs a child in the AppContainer
      that never imports the workload driver.  It reports interpreter
      startup, its own token, a loopback connection attempt to a dedicated
      listener of the orchestrator, the dependency imports under the guard,
      and a lookup of "localhost" that is supplementary evidence only.  The
      orchestrator first proves the listener reachable from outside (one
      control connection), and again after the child; the child's attempt
      counts as denied only on WSAEACCES (10013) - refusal, timeout,
      unreachable or other errors are inconclusive failures - and the
      listener must have received nothing from it.  Only loopback denial is
      tested, not external network denial.  No external name or service,
      Kafka, PostgreSQL or OTLP is contacted.
    - Inside the child, as defence in depth only: a Python-level guard
      blocks socket creation, connect/connect_ex/sendto/sendmsg, and name
      resolution (getaddrinfo, getnameinfo, gethostbyname[_ex],
      gethostbyaddr, create_connection, create_server, socketpair, fromfd),
      and the native network libraries (grpc, the OTLP exporters,
      confluent_kafka, psycopg, kafka) are replaced by stubs that refuse
      to be used.  Any attempt fails the run and stops the series.
    - The orchestrator observes the child and its descendants at the OS
      level (TCP connections, UDP endpoints, loaded network DLLs), failing
      closed on any observation error.  The observation is periodic and
      cannot see name resolution done by the Windows DNS Client service.
    - Neither the Python guard nor the periodic observation guarantees
      network isolation.  They are evidence, not denial.

Proposed operational workflow (each step needs its OWN authorization; none
is performed by this file):
    1. Create the AppContainer profile APPCONTAINER_PROFILE with no
       capabilities (CreateAppContainerProfile); record its SID; confirm no
       loopback exemption (CheckNetIsolation LoopbackExempt -s).
    2. Snapshot the ACLs (icacls <path> /save) of the Python installation,
       the venv, the repository and a dedicated output directory; grant the
       profile SID read+execute on the first three and modify on the
       output directory only.
    3. Set AUTHORIZED_APPCONTAINER_SID, PROBE_ENABLED and APPROVED_PROBES
       (a reviewed code change), then run one isolation probe (--probe):
       the orchestrator listens on an ephemeral 127.0.0.1 port that the
       probe must fail to reach; the token must validate; CPython and the
       dependency imports must work.  No external address is contacted.
    4. Restore the ACLs from the snapshot (icacls /restore) and verify them;
       delete the profile (DeleteAppContainerProfile) unless step 5 is
       authorized in the same window.
    5. Enabling calibration (EXECUTION_ENABLED, APPROVED_CALIBRATIONS) is a
       reviewed code change; running a calibration run or series is a
       separate authorization, followed by step 4.

Outputs go only to <temp>/agentops-calibration (never inside the repository,
never inside the benchmark directory).  Nothing in the benchmark directory
is written by this file.

Analysis is descriptive: delayed-request groups, delay propagation, burst
association, late-start distribution.  These are OBSERVATIONS; no cause of
a delay is inferred from them.
