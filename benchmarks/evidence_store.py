"""
benchmarks/evidence_store.py

Offline evidence store (slice E1) for the future isolated AppContainer
runs: the immutable, hash-chained evidence record schema, chain
verification, recovery classification, and a writer that works ONLY
through an injected file-system interface (FsOps).

Nothing here touches a real file system, process or network by default:
the writer only ever calls the FsOps object it is given, and the harness
does not import this module.  WindowsFsOps (slice E2) is the Windows
adapter: kernel32 through ctypes (CreateFileW, WriteFile, ReadFile,
FlushFileBuffers, CloseHandle, GetFileInformationByHandle,
GetFinalPathNameByHandleW, GetHandleInformation), loaded lazily.  It can
only be constructed with EVIDENCE_WRITES_ENABLED True (it is False) AND a
sealed calibration or probe authorization from the harness gates (closed),
and every native call re-checks both.  The harness is never imported from
here: its already initialized module is looked up in sys.modules, and an
absent, partially initialized or replaced module refuses.  It never creates
directories.

Durability limits of WindowsFsOps: the record is created with
FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH, flushed with FlushFileBuffers, closed, reopened
and re-read; this proves the logical content, not power-loss durability.
Directory entries are not flushed, a device may ignore flushes, and the
re-read may be served from the cache.

Record contracts: a record's (schema, writer_version) pair selects its
contract.  Strict records ("agentops-evidence/2", "evidence-store/e2") carry
the observed job configuration, the applied creation attributes and the
complete job-membership and token evidence, all validated by the planner's
pure validators; job assignment is accepted only AT creation.  Legacy
records ("agentops-evidence/1", "evidence-store/e1") are verified under
their original rules only and never satisfy a strict requirement; one chain
never mixes contracts; any other pair is refused.  The writer writes strict
records only.

Integrity model, stated precisely: a hash chain detects a deleted,
reordered, truncated or altered record.  It is NOT authentication - anyone
able to rewrite every record can recompute every hash.  The verified chain
tip digest is exposed so that it can later be anchored in separately
trusted evidence.  "Verified written" means written, flushed through FsOps,
closed, re-read and matched; it is not a claim of crash durability.

Standard library only.
