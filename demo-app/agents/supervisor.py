agents/supervisor.py

Supervisor Agent for the AgentOps demo-app (Milestone 1).

Implemented as two explicit LangGraph node functions, matching the two
points the Supervisor appears at in the approved happy path:

    User -> supervisor_start_node -> research_plan_node -> retrieval_node
         -> tool_agent_node -> research_synthesize_node
         -> supervisor_finalize_node -> User

No LLM calls, no network calls, no randomness. request_id/session_id are
established by the invocation layer (main.py), not by the Supervisor -
these nodes only read/pass through existing state.
"""

# Deterministic placeholder used when user_request is blank/whitespace
# after stripping, so downstream nodes always receive non-empty input.
_EMPTY_REQUEST_PLACEHOLDER = "No request was provided."

# Deterministic fallback used if synthesized_answer is missing.
_MISSING_SYNTHESIS_FALLBACK = (
    "No research result was available to finalize a response."

    Returns an update only when the normalized value differs from the

    Does not call other agent functions directly.
