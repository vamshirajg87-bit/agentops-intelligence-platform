"""
agents/research.py

Research Agent for the AgentOps demo-app (Milestone 1).

Implemented as two explicit LangGraph node functions, matching the two
distinct points the Research Agent appears at in the approved happy path:

    Supervisor -> research_plan_node -> Retrieval -> Tool Agent
                -> research_synthesize_node -> Supervisor

No LLM calls, no network calls, no randomness, no embeddings. Query
generation and synthesis are both deterministic, rule-based string
processing.

Research does NOT perform retrieval itself and does NOT call Tool Agent
functions directly - orchestration between nodes is the graph's job.
