"""
data/sample_docs.py

Static local "corpus" used by the Retrieval Agent in Milestone 1.

This is NOT a vector database and contains no embeddings. It is a
small, fixed, hardcoded set of documents used purely to demonstrate
deterministic keyword/token matching in the Retrieval Agent.

Each document is treated as a single chunk (no sub-document chunking
in Milestone 1) to keep retrieval logic simple and deterministic.
