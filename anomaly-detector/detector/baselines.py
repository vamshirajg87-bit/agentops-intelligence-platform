    value
        The numeric measurement.  None values are skipped during baseline
        computation; this supports nullable mart columns such as
        retrieval_top_relevance_score.

    start_time
        When the operation began.  Used for baseline window filtering.
        Must be consistently timezone-aware or timezone-naive across all
        observations passed to compute_baseline in a single call.

    is_error
        True when this span had status_code = 'ERROR'.  Callers may pass
        exclude_errors=True to omit error observations from latency baselines
        so that slow-then-fail spans do not contaminate normal-operation durations.
