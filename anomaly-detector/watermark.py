Checkpoint persistence for the Phase 10.5 anomaly detector runner.

Each (signal_path, service_name, operation_name) detection group has one
checkpoint row in public.anomaly_detector_runs.  The checkpoint_at column
holds the query_end of the last successfully committed runner invocation for
that group — not the query_start, which is always computed dynamically.

Public API
----------
    read_checkpoint()   — return the stored checkpoint_at, or None if absent
    write_checkpoint()  — forward-only UPSERT of checkpoint_at

Connection ownership
--------------------
This module does NOT open, commit, rollback, or close any database connection.
The caller supplies the connection and owns its full lifecycle:

    conn = db.connect()
    checkpoint = read_checkpoint(conn, ...)
    # ... run detection ...
    write_checkpoint(conn, ..., checkpoint_at=new_boundary)
    conn.commit()   # caller's responsibility
    conn.close()    # caller's responsibility

The write_checkpoint call participates in whatever transaction the caller
manages.  The checkpoint and the anomaly INSERTs it covers must be committed
atomically; that commit belongs to the runner, not here.

Forward-only semantics
----------------------
write_checkpoint uses an UPSERT with a WHERE clause on the conflict update:

    WHERE public.anomaly_detector_runs.checkpoint_at < EXCLUDED.checkpoint_at

This ensures:
  - First write inserts.
  - A newer checkpoint_at advances the stored value.
  - An identical checkpoint_at is a no-op (row unchanged).
  - An older checkpoint_at cannot rewind the stored value.

There is no rewind function.  Checkpoint resets needed for testing or operator
recovery must be performed by an admin role outside the anomaly_detector service.
