"""
anomaly-detector/telemetry_queries.py

PostgreSQL read-only data access layer for anomaly detector telemetry.

All functions accept a psycopg.Connection and return list[dict[str, Any]] rows
via the dict_row row factory.  All variable values use %(name)s parameter
binding; no values are interpolated into SQL strings.  Relation names are
fixed module-level constants.

Half-open interval convention: [window_start, window_end)
    event_time >= window_start
    event_time  < window_end

The caller (Phase 10.4E) is responsible for deriving exact window_start and
window_end from detector configuration.  This module executes the requested
bounds exactly — it does not add safety buffers or reinterpret detector config.

Public API:

    fetch_agent_latency_history()     — analytics.mart_agent_metrics
