incident-retrieval/historical_context.py

Phase 12.7: Historical context for one investigation.

Presents existing, authoritative RCA data next to the semantic retrieval
result: the current investigation, its retrieval status, and for each
historically similar investigation its raw similarity and a few fields
recorded by the RCA analyzer.

Historical similarity provides context only.  It does not prove that the
current incident has the same root cause as any historical investigation.
This module performs no analysis of its own: it does not reason about causes,
does not generate text, and does not interpret the similarity value.  The RCA
analyzer remains the authoritative evidence-based analysis.

Flow:
  find_similar_investigations() -> one batch fetch of investigation context
  for the current investigation and every match -> validate -> result

Retrieval is delegated entirely to similarity_search.find_similar_investigations();
its status, embedding_id, top_k, similarity values and match order are passed
through unchanged.

Similarity
----------
similarity is the raw cosine similarity returned by retrieval.  It is not
rounded, not bucketed, not compared with a threshold, and not a confidence.
"confidence" in this module always means the confidence the RCA analyzer
recorded for that investigation.

Fail closed
-----------
If the context of the current investigation or of any match cannot be read,
or the returned rows are duplicated, unexpected, or malformed, RuntimeError
is raised.  A match is never silently dropped.

Read-only
---------
SELECTs only, through embedding_store.  This module never writes, never
commits, never rolls back, and never closes the connection: the caller owns
the connection and its transaction.

This module contains no SQL and does not import a database driver.  No model
is loaded.

Public API:
    HISTORICAL_CONTEXT_DISCLAIMER  — fixed statement shown with every result
    InvestigationContext           — RCA fields of one investigation (frozen)
    HistoricalMatch                — one match: similarity + context (frozen)
    HistoricalContext              — result of one call (frozen)
