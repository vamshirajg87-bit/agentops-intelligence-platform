incident-retrieval/embedding_store.py

Phase 12.5: Database access for embedding persistence.
Phase 12.6: Similarity query over stored embeddings.

This module holds every SQL statement of the component.  It reads the
investigation and evidence fields that the incident document needs, writes
one row to public.rca_investigation_embeddings, and ranks stored embeddings
by cosine similarity to one stored query embedding.

Role
----
All statements run as the incident_retrieval role (migration 011) and use
only what that role is granted:

    public.rca_investigations            SELECT on selected columns
    public.rca_evidence                  SELECT on selected columns
    public.rca_investigation_embeddings  INSERT, SELECT

Idempotency
-----------
embedding rows:  ON CONFLICT (investigation_id, doc_version, model_name,
                 model_revision) DO NOTHING

First-write-wins: an existing row is never overwritten.  No UPDATE, no DELETE.

Transactions
------------
Functions here never commit or roll back.  The caller owns the transaction
and supplies an open connection, which it also closes.

SQL safety
----------
All values are %(name)s bound parameters.  No string interpolation.  Explicit
column lists.  No SELECT *.

The embedding is bound as text in pgvector's input format and cast with
::vector.  embedded_at is not supplied; the column has DEFAULT NOW().

Similarity query
----------------
The query vector is a stored row, referenced by its embedding_id inside the
statement; no vector is sent from Python.  Candidates must share the query's
doc_version, model_name, and model_revision, and the query's own
investigation is excluded.

    cosine distance    = candidate.embedding <=> query.embedding
    cosine similarity  = 1.0 - cosine distance

Ordering is cosine distance ASC, then investigation_id ASC.  The search is
exact; there is no similarity threshold.

Investigation context (Phase 12.7)
----------------------------------
One batch SELECT returns the presentation fields of several investigations
at once, so historical context needs a single query rather than one per
match.  Rows come back ordered by investigation_id; callers that need another
order look rows up by id.

Public API:
    EMBEDDING_COLUMN_DIMENSION      — dimension of the embedding column (384)
    fetch_investigation()           — one investigation, or None
    fetch_evidence()                — its evidence rows, rank_position ASC
    fetch_stored_document_text()    — document_text of an embedding, or None
    insert_embedding()              — insert one row; True if inserted
    fetch_similar_investigations()  — ranked (investigation_id, similarity)
    fetch_investigation_contexts()  — presentation fields for a set of ids
