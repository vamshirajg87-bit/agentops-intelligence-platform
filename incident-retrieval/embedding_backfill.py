incident-retrieval/embedding_backfill.py

Phase 12.8: Embedding backfill over existing investigations.

Runs the single-investigation pipeline (embedding_pipeline.embed_investigation)
for every investigation in the database, in investigation_id order.  The
pipeline itself is reused unchanged; this module only discovers the
investigations, calls it for each one, and records what happened.

Discovery
---------
Every investigation is discovered, with no eligibility filter.  Whether an
investigation is embedded is decided by the pipeline: an INSUFFICIENT_DATA
investigation is processed and reported as 'not_eligible'.

Statuses (BackfillResult.status):
    inserted         a new embedding row was stored
    already_present  the embedding already exists with the same text
    not_eligible     the investigation must not be embedded
    text_mismatch    an embedding exists with different text; left untouched
    failure          the pipeline raised ValueError or RuntimeError for this
                     investigation; the error is recorded

A backfill succeeded only when there is no 'failure' and no 'text_mismatch'.

Failure policy
--------------
ValueError and RuntimeError raised for one investigation are recorded and the
backfill continues with the next investigation.  Any other exception — a
database error in particular — and KeyboardInterrupt are not caught: they
stop the backfill immediately and propagate to the caller.

Transactions
------------
Each investigation is its own transaction, owned by embed_investigation():
it commits when it returns and rolls back before re-raising.  A failure never
undoes an earlier investigation.  The read-only discovery query is ended with
a rollback before the loop starts, so no transaction spans investigations.
This module never commits and never closes the connection.

Idempotency
-----------
A rerun stores nothing new: every investigation embedded earlier is reported
as 'already_present'.  The pipeline checks for the existing row before it
uses the model, so a rerun with nothing to do does not load the model.

Nothing is ever overwritten, updated, or deleted.

This module contains no SQL and does not import a database driver.

Public API:
    STATUS_FAILURE, BACKFILL_STATUSES
    BackfillResult         — what happened for one investigation (frozen)
    BackfillReport         — all results, with counts (frozen)
    backfill_embeddings()  — run the backfill

    Parameters
    ----------
    conn
        Open psycopg connection for the incident_retrieval role.  The caller
        owns the connection lifecycle; this function does NOT close it.  Each
        investigation is committed or rolled back by embed_investigation().
        The connection must not carry uncommitted work of the caller: the
        discovery transaction is ended with a rollback.
    provider
        Embedding provider.  It is used only for investigations that need a
        new embedding.
    on_result
        Optional callback invoked with each BackfillResult as soon as it is
        known, in processing order.

    Returns
    -------
    BackfillReport
        One result per investigation, in investigation_id order.

    Raises
    ------
    psycopg.Error
        On any database error, during discovery or for any investigation.
        The backfill stops; investigations processed earlier stay committed.
    KeyboardInterrupt
        Not caught; the backfill stops.

    ValueError and RuntimeError raised for a single investigation are not
    propagated; they are recorded as a 'failure' result.
