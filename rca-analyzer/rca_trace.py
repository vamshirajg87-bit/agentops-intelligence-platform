rca-analyzer/rca_trace.py

Phase 11.2: RCA-owned trace reconstruction.

Pure-Python, database-independent trace reconstruction for the RCA analyzer.
Reconstructs parent-child relationships from a flat list of SpanRecord objects.
No database access, no I/O.

Behavioral reference: trace-viewer/reconstruction.py (same 3-color DFS
semantics for cycle detection, same orphan handling, same sibling ordering).
Differences from the trace-viewer implementation:
  - TraceNode carries a depth field (0 = root, 1 = direct child, etc.)
  - TraceReconstruction carries trace_duration_ms (wall-clock envelope)
  - SpanRecord promotes service_name as a non-defaulted required field
    (stg_telemetry_spans guarantees it is NOT NULL)
  - The rca-analyzer does not import trace-viewer as a production dependency

This file is the sole implementation of trace reconstruction in rca-analyzer.
A future telemetry-common package may merge both implementations once both
usages are stable.

Public API:
    SpanRecord          — input: one span from any source
    TraceNode           — output: a span positioned within the tree
    TraceReconstruction — output: the full reconstruction result
    build_trace_tree()  — entry point

Raises:
    ValueError  if any span_id appears more than once in the input.
    ValueError  if spans carry trace_id values from more than one trace.
