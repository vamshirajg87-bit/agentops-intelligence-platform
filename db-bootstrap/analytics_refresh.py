db-bootstrap/analytics_refresh.py

Phase 14.2: The one sanctioned way to rebuild the analytics models.

dbt replaces every relation of the analytics schema when it runs, and a
replaced relation loses the grants a migration made on it.  This program
does the whole operation, in this order, and fails if any part of it fails:

    dbt run -> post_dbt_grants.sql -> verify every analytics grant

It works only on a database the bootstrap has finished.  Any other database
is refused before anything is run: an empty one, one whose bootstrap stopped
half way, and one the bootstrap did not build.

It creates no role, applies no migration, and neither writes nor creates the
bootstrap's record of applied steps.  That record is read before and after,
and the refresh fails if the two readings differ.

Credentials
-----------
Only the owner role's password is needed, and it comes from the environment
exactly as it does for the bootstrap.  The application roles' passwords are
not read.

Everything is reused from bootstrap.py: configuration, the plan, the state
classifier, the child processes, and the verification.

Exit codes are the bootstrap's:
    0  refreshed and verified
    3  configuration
    4  the database could not be reached or read
    5  the database is not one this program may refresh; nothing was run
    6  dbt, the grants or the verification failed
    1  unexpected error

Public API:
    run_refresh()   — the whole procedure
    main()          — command-line entry point
